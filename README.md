## why i stopped
<br />I stopped playing anarchy because I have a life. 
<br />You have one too and you should spend you're time outside with your friends and family instead of spending hours a day staring at a screen. 
<br />If you're still young, this is a great reminder there is so much more to life then being online all the time or you're social status.
<br />There are people who care about you and there is no true-tail way to tell when you could never see those people again.
<br />On average, people using screens only 3â€“4 hours a day end up loosing 10 years of their life to the screens.
<br />I appreciate the time, memories, and relationships i've had the opportunity to make along the way, and, you for spending time reading my advice.
<br />I will never truly be gone,
<br />- xeon
