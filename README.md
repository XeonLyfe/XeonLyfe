<h2>Why I Stopped</h2>
<p>I stopped playing Anarchy because life is more important. You have a life too—spend it with friends and family instead of hours on a screen. If you’re young, remember there’s so much more beyond online status. People care about you, and you never know when you might not see them again.</p>
<p>On average, spending more than 3–4 hours daily on screens can cost you years of life. I cherish the memories and connections I've made, and I appreciate you taking the time to read my message.</p>
<p>I’m never truly gone<br>- Xeon</p>
